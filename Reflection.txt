Answer --> Branches are powerful and safe for a team to collaborate on a single project is that it allows for individuals to do their work on their own branch without making changes to whatever may be on the main branch, it also allows for easy debugging as changes can be tracked down easily. It prevents unwanted changes and allows for full history to be seen in case of errors to help narrow down where it may have come from and correct them if necessary.
